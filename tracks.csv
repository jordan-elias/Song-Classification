<p>Back in the late 80's I walked into the Ritz in the middle of the Laughing Hyenas and watched in disbelief while singer John Brannon churned out one hell of a gutteral yowl for the duration of a whole set in almost inhuman fashion.

Later it all came into focus: NA were very much first-wave and represented Detroit as one of the pockets dotted around the USA (see Black Flag, Minor Threat, Bad Brains), with Brannon &amp; company consolidating the midwest brotherhood with the Necros and Meatmen and eventually moving into early singles via Corey Rusk's Touch and Go label (originally a zine, where yes, people learned of the underground way before the internet). As far as first-wave HC goes, Negative Approach were among the most vicious feedback-pummel units going. Songs careened by in seconds, were pretty much politics-free, focusing on sheer vocal/instrumental destruction. They were inspired by not only their American peers, but UK groundbreakers like Discharge (who, like, NA, were big Stooges fans). In 2006 they returned to the stage at the Touch and Go label anniversary, with Brannon and original drummer Chris Moore augmented by Ron Sakowski on bass and Harold Richardson on guitar, reportedly wiped the place down.

Later it all came into focus: NA were very much first-wave and represented Detroit as one of the pockets dotted around the USA (see Black Flag, Minor Threat, Bad Brains), with Brannon &amp; company consolidating the midwest brotherhood with the Necros and Meatmen and eventually moving into early singles via Corey Rusk's Touch and Go label (originally a zine, where yes, people learned of the underground way before the internet). As far as first-wave HC goes, Negative Approach were among the most vicious feedback-pummel units going.

They were inspired by not only their American peers, but UK groundbreakers like Discharge (who, like, NA, were big Stooges fans). In 2006 they returned to the stage at the Touch and Go label anniversary, with Brannon and original drummer Chris Moore augmented by Ron Sakowski on bass and Harold Richardson on guitar, reportedly wiped the place down.

While the Alps' junkpile approach to classic rock via wasted echo-chamber vocals and lost-in-space mod guitars might sound like a bad trip to some, there's a real cohesion and weirdly tuneful vibe carried through the scuzz that might make their new LP Description of the Harbor one of your year's faves. More info at www.sicalps.com. The band ees: Mike Donovan - vox, guitar, Matthew Hartman: drums, bass (on last tune). Songs today: Gruxxe Bathe Ballade, Brill Building, Mater, C.O./C.A., A Story Over There, Latin, Stories, Everywhere There, Semi-Streets, I Know Where the Madness Goes.</span></p>

Backed up by three other Teasers, he performs for you today on Brian's show. Says Wallers: ""Country Teasers was a manner and a style, created to execute a disciplined programme against a perceived problem in music and politics; The Rebel is pure music and word. Did you like The Residents but wished the verses weren't always the same scan/rhyme pattern? Do you like the way The Shadow Ring disobey all rules but still produce beauty and real emotion? Tune in, because at least you'll find these problems solved for you, if not your dismay with all music."" More info at the Rebel's <a href=""http://www.therebel.co.uk/"">site</a>. The Rebel is: B.R.

It later went through a great many changes in form and arrangement, from various live band versions to the final recorded version on Angels of Light - Everything is Good Here/Please Come Home (even that version was rerecorded and further transformed during those sessions). Of all of them, I now like this version the best. Oh well, no going back…</p>

lyrics
You never know just how long you have 
Before you go 
Away 

So take back life; hide it from view 
It will only be us and 
the wind 

Times are down but we’re ok 
Lines are down but we’re ok 
We’re ok. 

You never know just how many times 
You get to say 
Hello 

Come out with me take the f-train 
Into the night 
We’ll disappear 

Times are down but we’re ok 
Lines are down but we’re ok 
We’re ok. 

When you send light into the world 
It scatters and reflects 
But it never dies",2302,,Attribution-Noncommercial-Share Alike 3.0 United States,1557,,3,,[],ok
